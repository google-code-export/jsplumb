future

    (none of these things are definite.  i just like to keep a list of ideas that i've bounced around with various people)

    - have a toFront and toBack method available on Connection (and on return value from jsPlumb.select method).
    would require some notion of what the default zindex was. how best to do that?

    - expose "rehomeEndpoint" method on jsPlumb (and 'rehome' on Endpoint); this takes an Endpoint and moves it
    to a different parent. should take an optional second method to provide the Container to use.

    - add jsPlumb.selectEndpoints(...); behaves the same way as .select, but for Endpoints

    - add "perimeter" anchors: basically helper methods that create a set of dynamic anchors that together approximate the perimeter of some shape.  so if you had circles, for instance, it would be straightforward to get a set of anchors that travel around the circumference of each one.  or ellipses. whatever.  also look into the possibility of jsPlumb interacting directly with SVG/VML elements to determine their perimeter.

    - allow for "named" endpoint types: the user can register a full set of parameters for some endpoint and then just refer to it in code:

        jsPlumb.register("foo", {
            endpoint:["Dot", {radius:50}],
            paintStyle:{fillStyle:"red"}
        });

        ...

        jsPlumb.addEndpoint("anElement", "foo");

                or
            
        jsPlumb.addEndpoint("anElement", "foo", { ... optional extra params ... } );




1.3.9
    - do not set jsplumb scope on draggables when it's just some div you are making draggable. (issue 245) DONE

1.3.5
       
    - refactor assigning endpoint styles into a common helper method    DONE    
    - oncontextmenu event bind  DONE
    
1.3.6

	- mix of standard anchors on one end and continuous on the other does not paint  (done)
	- arrow overlay on flowchart sometimes jumps  (done)
	- random drag log entries  (done)
	- importDefaults({ some defaults })  method on jsPlumb (like a bulk import) DONE
    - draggable by parent issue from google code DONE

possible future enhancements

    - beforeDrag interceptor
    - straight connector with continuous anchors disappears when horizontal or vertical (fixed?)
    - single SVG element/single VML group/single Canvas per page?
    - qunit: add helper methods to simulate mousedown and drag.  then write some functional tests.
    - image overlay?
    - make AnchorManager the source of knowledge about connections (remove connections by scope etc)   

    - z-index: make a highlighted connection or one which is connected to an element that is being dragged come to the top over other connections.  have a toFront and toBack method available on Connection (and on return value from jsPlumb.select method)

    - jsPlumb should handle scope, dragActive etc. then can support multiple scopes.

    - paint style "profiles": labelled paint styles, with inheritance. so hover, as an example, could extend from some normal state, and just override a couple of values.  or you might have different "types" of connections, the paint styles for which could extend some default.
